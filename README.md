[![Python package](https://github.com/goujilinouhaila-coder/Multiplication_table/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/goujilinouhaila-coder/Multiplication_table/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

## Synopsis
In this project; we will explore some of the symmetries that hide in the distribution of numbers in the multiplication table of positive integers when viewed through modulo k arithmetic as we vary k; in a way that we know less often: Modular Arithmetic. Based on our construction process; The graphic presentation contains only straight lines; in other words, it is a kind of optical illusion that we are witnessing and it is the entanglement of all these straight lines that gives us the impression of this curved figure that appears.

The only image that can possibly be remembered for modular arithmetic is that of trigonometry. But it is the same mechanics for a simple clock: every time the needle performs a circle turn, we return to the same number. Mathematically speaking, the clock is said to have a modular system of 12: the number 13 returns to the number 1. This type of system can allow us to represent multiplication tables. By placing a certain number of points on a circle and connecting the points following a multiplication. 

## Wonder 
By exploring the multiplication tables, each time we will see on the figure less strokes of what should be there; this means that the square of the multiplication table that is being studied is equal to 1 modulate the number of points. 

## Getting the code
Clone project and charge current directory to it 

```sh 
    git clone git@github.com:goujilinouhaila-coder/Multiplication_table.git
```

```
    cd Multiplication_table
```

## Install

You can discover our package in the link below: 

https://pypi.org/project/multiplication-table/

## Structure 
The structure of our project is as follows:

The beamer presentation is kept in the ./beamer folder. 

/.multiplication_table/Test contains all the tests implemented on the package'functions. 

In addition, we used a continuous integration action diposed in ./github/workflows folder.

The main code is in the /.multiplication_table folder.

Finally, to try if our package works well we tested it on some examples that are stored in thefolder /.Example
