## Synopsis
In this project; we will explore some of the symmetries that hide in the distribution of numbers in the multiplication table of positive reals when viewed through modulo k arithmetic as we vary k; in a way that we know less often: Modular Arithmetic. Based on our construction process; The graphic presentation contains only straight lines; in other words, it is a kind of optical illusion that we are witnessing and it is the entanglement of all these straight lines that gives us the impression of this curved figure that appears.

The only image that can possibly be remembered for modular arithmetic is that of trigonometry. But it is the same mechanics for a simple clock: every time the needle performs a circle turn, we return to the same number. Mathematically speaking, the clock is said to have a modular system of 12: the number 13 returns to the number 1. This type of system can allow us to represent multiplication tables. By placing a certain number of points on a circle and connecting the points following a multiplication. 

## Wonder 
By exploring the multiplication tables, each time we will see on the figure less strokes of what should be there; this means that the square of the multiplication table that is being studied is equal to 1 modulate the number of points. 

## Getting the code
You can clone the repository on your local machine and go to it thanks to the following commands :  

```sh 
    $ git clone https://github.com/goujilinouhaila-coder/Multiplication_table.git
```
```
    $ cd Multiplication_table
```

## Install

To install this package, you can run its command prompt the following line.

```sh
$ pip install multiplication_table 
```

And also, you can discover it in the link below: 

**https://pypi.org/project/multiplication-table/** 

## Documentation 

The documentation of this package is available [here](https://multiplication-table.readthedocs.io/en/assia/index.html). 

## Structure 
The structure of our project is as follows:

The beamer presentation is kept in the `./beamer` folder. A documentation will be made using the sphinx package and is kept in the `./doc` directory.. 

`/.multiplication_table/Test` contains all the tests implemented on the package'functions. 

In addition, we used a continuous integration action diposed in `./github/workflows` folder.

The main code is in the `/.multiplication_table` folder. And The `./report` folder contains a jupyter notebook, that generates the graph on the console and the graphical interface.

You can  get a list of the installed package in the `./requirements.txt` folder. 

Finally, to try if our package works well we tested it on some examples that are stored in thefolder `/.Example`
